        Breeding, raising, and feeding animals for food is a tremendously
        inefficient use of our natural resources. Animals raised for food
        production are fed over half of the all the world's crops. As our
        population grows, we require more and more agricultural space. 60% of
        worldwide deforestation results from land being converted for use as
        agricultural land, much of which is used for grazing cattle. An
        estimated 14% of the world's population (over 850,000,000 people) suffer
        from undernourishment while we continue to waste valuable agricultural
        land and resources to produce animal products, therefore obtaining only
        a fraction of the potential caloric value. Continuing this foolish
        management of our natural resources is simply not sustainable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Regardless of concerns over animal cruelty in factory farms, there's
        another issue at hand when considering animal welfare. Should we be
        treating animals as commodities at all? As humans, do we reserve the
        right to use animals as we please? Many vegans believe that we should
        not. We no longer need to rely on animals for food or clothing, so it
        does seem self-indulgent to continue to put our cravings, appetites, and
        desires ahead of the lives and well-being of other living creatures.
        This issue is one where people tend to either agree or disagree and it's
        often very difficult to sway someone to agree with your point of view.
        It's something that deserves a little research and time spent to decide
        where you stand on the issue.
        <br />
        A vegan diet can be one of the healthiest ways to live. Plant-based
        diets should contain plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole
        grains, beans, legumes, nuts and seeds. Because vegan diets often rely
        heavily on these healthy staples, they tend to be higher in vitamins,
        minerals, phytochemicals, and fibre. Healthy vegan diets are abundant
        with vitamins B1, C, and E, folic acid, magnesium, and iron while also
        being low in cholesterol and saturated fats.
